description: Implement a plan or scoped change with Claude, verify it, obtain a read-only Codex GPT-6 Astra review at medium reasoning, immediately surface every reviewer finding before review-driven fixes, validate and fix confirmed findings, then report every finding and final disposition in Traditional Chinese alongside a purpose-led per-file summary. Use for end-to-end implementation requests that require Claude implementation with GPT-6 Astra or cross-model review. Fall back to an independent Claude review when Codex is unavailable and disclose the reason.

# Claude Implement with GPT-6 Astra Review

Claude owns implementation, final technical judgment, fixes, verification, and reporting. Codex GPT-6 Astra is a read-only reviewer.

## Workflow

1. Read the requirements, repository instructions, and starting `git status`; preserve unrelated changes.
2. Implement without committing, pushing, deploying, or expanding scope unless requested.
3. Run proportionate checks.
4. Request a read-only Codex GPT-6 Astra review against the requirements, diff, and check results.
5. Immediately present every returned finding to the user before making any review-driven code change. Mark these as unvalidated reviewer findings, not Claude's final judgment.
6. Validate every finding; accept only concrete correctness, regression, security, requirement, or meaningful test-coverage issues.
7. Present Claude's acceptance or rejection decisions, then fix accepted findings and rerun affected checks. Reject style-only, speculative, or false-positive findings.
8. If fixes are material, run one final pass with the same reviewer. Maximum: two review passes. Repeat the immediate disclosure for that pass.
9. Report the result in Traditional Chinese using the format below. Include every usable finding returned by every review pass, even when it was rejected or already fixed.

## Progress Updates

These rules apply to the whole workflow — long-running implementation or verification work and every non-interactive agent invocation (Codex review passes and any Claude subprocess) alike:

- While any long-running step is in progress, send the user a concise status update at least every 60 seconds: which phase and step is running, elapsed time, and remaining wait budget where one applies.
- Run every long-running agent invocation under a liveness watcher that distinguishes "still running" from "process exited without producing a result". Report a dead invocation immediately with the evidence found, instead of waiting for a timeout or the next user message.
- If the coordinating session is interrupted or restarted while an invocation is running, state that immediately at the start of the next turn: what was lost, what evidence remains, and the recovery plan.
- Report phase transitions (implementation done, checks passing or failing, review started, findings returned) as they happen; do not batch them into the final report.

## Codex GPT-6 Astra Review

Use Codex GPT-6 Astra for every review pass. Run non-interactively at medium reasoning in read-only review mode.

Never run `codex exec` in the foreground or as a directly tracked background command: a review routinely runs past 10 minutes, a foreground call is killed at the tool timeout, a tracked background call is killed when the session restarts, and a killed pass emits no findings at all. Launch it through a wrapper script that returns immediately:

```bash
cat > /tmp/codex-review.sh <<'WRAPPER'
#!/bin/sh
codex exec -C "$PWD" \
  --model gpt-6-astra \
  --config 'model_reasoning_effort="medium"' \
  review - > /tmp/codex-review.log 2>&1 <<'EOF'
<focused review prompt>
EOF
echo "CODEX_EXIT=$?" >> /tmp/codex-review.log
WRAPPER
chmod +x /tmp/codex-review.sh
nohup /tmp/codex-review.sh > /tmp/codex-review-launcher.log 2>&1 &
```

- Use `nohup`, not `setsid`; macOS has no `setsid`.
- Never send the launcher's own output to `/dev/null`; a failed launch must stay visible.
- Confirm the wrapper detached: its PPID becomes 1.
- Poll the log for the `CODEX_EXIT=` line and treat it as the only completion signal. A log that stopped growing without it means the pass was killed.
- Resume a killed pass with `codex exec resume --last` instead of restarting it, and count the resumed run as the same pass.

Pass the focused review prompt through stdin (`-`) using a heredoc inside the wrapper, never as a file argument to `codex`. State the review scope in the first line of the prompt (for example "Review the uncommitted changes in this repository"). Instruct Codex not to run test suites or package-manager commands, and state that the checks this workflow already ran are authoritative; its sandbox reports failures that are environment artifacts and the runs consume the wait budget. List the changed files in the prompt so Codex does not spend the budget discovering them. After the review returns, confirm from its output that Codex enumerated the intended changes.

In the prompt, include the requirements, implementation scope, changed files or diff, checks, and pre-existing changes to ignore. Require numbered findings with severity, file/line, failure mode, and fix direction, plus an explicit statement when there are no findings. Exclude formatting, naming, subjective style, and unrelated improvements. Treat findings as evidence, not authority.

Retain the review output until the final report is complete. Present every usable reviewer finding in `Review 結果`, including rejected findings and findings fixed before a later clean pass. Do not replace the findings with only a pass/fail conclusion, a count, “已修正”, or the final reviewer approval. Faithfully summarize each finding; quote the reviewer only when its exact wording matters. Exact duplicates may be consolidated only when all original finding IDs are listed.

### Immediate Finding Disclosure

After each review invocation returns, send a commentary update before editing any code in response to that review. Do not defer this disclosure to the final report.

Use the heading `Codex GPT-6 Astra Review Pass N — 初始 findings（尚未經 Claude 驗證）` and include the provider plus every usable finding's ID, severity, file/line, failure mode, impact, and proposed fix direction. State clearly that Claude may accept or reject each finding after inspecting the code. When the reviewer reports no findings, immediately say `本 pass 無 findings`.

After validation, send a second concise commentary update with the acceptance or rejection of each finding and the reason before or while applying accepted fixes. The later final report remains the authoritative record of findings, decisions, changes, and verification.

### Wait Limit

Use a cumulative 30-minute wait budget for all Codex review invocations in the workflow, including a final pass after fixes:

- Record how long each Codex invocation runs. A later pass may use only the wait budget left by earlier passes.
- Do not declare a timeout merely because Codex has not produced intermediate output.
- Poll or wait in intervals no longer than 60 seconds, and give the user a concise status update at least every 60 seconds while the review is still running.
- When the cumulative wait reaches 30 minutes, terminate any running Codex invocation and do not start another one, even if a pass appears to be making progress.
- Do not retry after exhausting the wait budget; timeout is not a clearly correctable invocation error. Use the fallback below for any required review pass.

## Codex Failure Fallback

If Codex returns no usable review—because of access, quota, policy, authentication, timeout, tooling, context, or malformed output—retry once only when the invocation is clearly correctable; otherwise use independent Claude review:

```bash
claude -p "<focused review prompt>" \
  --effort high \
  --permission-mode plan \
  --tools "Read,Grep,Glob,Bash"
```

Launch the fallback detached the same way, with the same completion sentinel.

Pass the same review context to the fallback. Immediately identify the fallback with the specific, sanitized reason:

```text
Review provider: Claude (fallback — Codex unavailable: <specific reason>)
```

After fallback, use Claude for remaining passes and count them toward the two-pass limit. State that the review was independent, not cross-model, and never imply Codex approved it. If fallback also fails, report both failures and stop review work.

## Final Report

Write explanations and headings in Traditional Chinese; preserve commands, identifiers, paths, model names, and required provider labels. Lead with outcomes, not chronology. Use exactly these sections:

```markdown
## 實作結果

- 第一點先說明本次開發要解決的使用者／系統問題、原本缺少的能力，以及完成後具備的能力。
- 其餘 1–3 點列出使用者可見行為與重要架構結果。

## 檔案摘要

### `path/to/file.ts` — 新增／修改／刪除／重新命名

- **開發目的**：先指出這個檔案承接哪一項需求或使用情境、原本的缺口／風險，以及它在整體開發中負責完成什麼能力。
- **具體變更**：指出變更的元件、函式、型別、schema、route、設定鍵或測試案例，以及各自改了什麼。
- **設計理由**：說明為什麼選擇這個 boundary、資料結構或流程，以及它如何滿足限制或避免已知風險；沒有非顯而易見的設計判斷時省略。
- **行為與資料流**：說明重要條件、狀態轉換、輸入輸出、錯誤處理或呼叫鏈的前後差異；不適用時省略。

```

Build `檔案摘要` from starting status and final diff. Include every task-owned source, test, support, config, documentation, deletion, rename, and review fix; exclude pre-existing user changes. Create one subsection per path and list each path exactly once.

Make every entry concrete enough that the user can understand the implementation without opening the diff:

- Derive `開發目的` from the plan, acceptance criteria, user scenario, or scoped requirements before reading the diff as an implementation inventory. Do not infer purpose only from symbol names or restate the mechanics as intent.
- Make the role of each file in the overall change explicit: identify what development responsibility it owns, why that responsibility belongs there, and which downstream behavior or requirement depends on it.
- Keep `開發目的`, `具體變更`, and `設計理由` distinct: purpose explains why the capability is needed; concrete change explains what was implemented; design rationale explains why this implementation shape was chosen.
- Name the important symbols, UI regions, endpoints, data fields, configuration keys, or test scenarios changed in that file.
- Describe meaningful before/after behavior, including branching, fallback, validation, state, persistence, side effects, and error handling when relevant.
- For tests, name the exact behavior and edge cases covered and the expected outcome; do not merely say that tests were added.
- For configuration, migrations, generated support files, and documentation, identify the exact entries or sections changed and their runtime or developer-facing effect.
- For deletions, explain which responsibility was removed and where it moved or why it is no longer needed. For renames, show `old/path → new/path` and state whether content also changed.
- Identify changes originating from accepted review findings in the affected file entry.

Avoid vague summaries such as “更新邏輯”, “改善型別”, “重構元件”, “補上測試”, or “調整設定”. Prefer 2–5 information-dense bullets per file, expanding when a file contains multiple independent changes. Do not paste the diff or narrate trivial line-by-line edits.

Use this distinction:

```markdown
<!-- Too mechanical: the reader knows what changed but not why it exists. -->
- **具體變更**：新增 `redactReviewRequestV1` 與三種 detector。

<!-- Purpose-led: the reader can reconstruct the intended development. -->
- **開發目的**：在 `ReviewEngine` 前建立單向 sanitization boundary，避免啟用 cloud transport 時把 diff 中常見的 API key 或 private key 原文送出本機；這個檔案負責 Plan 14 的核心 redacted-request contract。
- **具體變更**：新增 `redactReviewRequestV1`、deterministic replacement tokens，以及 API key、private key、high-entropy token detectors。
- **設計理由**：對完整 request tree 做一次純 traversal，讓 path、patch、prompt 與 model 共用同一政策，避免各 engine adapter 各自 redaction 而產生漏接或行為分歧。
```

State whether Codex GPT-6 Astra completed review. For fallback, repeat the exact provider label and reason, and never imply Codex approved the work.
