description: Implement a plan or scoped change with Codex, verify it, obtain a read-only Claude Opus 5 review at high reasoning, immediately surface every reviewer finding before review-driven fixes, validate and fix confirmed findings, then report every finding and final disposition in Traditional Chinese alongside a purpose-led per-file summary. Use for end-to-end implementation requests that require Codex implementation with Claude Opus 5 or cross-model review. Fall back to an independent Codex review when Claude is unavailable and disclose the reason.

# Codex Implement with Opus 5 Review

Codex owns implementation, final technical judgment, fixes, verification, and reporting. Claude Opus 5 is a read-only reviewer.

## Workflow

1. Read the requirements, repository instructions, and starting `git status`; preserve unrelated changes.
2. Implement without committing, pushing, deploying, or expanding scope unless requested.
3. Run proportionate checks.
4. Request a read-only Claude Opus 5 review against the requirements, diff, and check results.
5. Immediately present every returned finding to the user before making any review-driven code change. Mark these as unvalidated reviewer findings, not Codex's final judgment.
6. Validate every finding; accept only concrete correctness, regression, security, requirement, or meaningful test-coverage issues.
7. Present Codex's acceptance or rejection decisions, then fix accepted findings and rerun affected checks. Reject style-only, speculative, or false-positive findings.
8. If fixes are material, run one final pass with the same reviewer. Maximum: two review passes. Repeat the immediate disclosure for that pass.
9. Report the result in Traditional Chinese using the format below. Include every usable finding returned by every review pass, even when it was rejected or already fixed.

## Claude Opus 5 Review

Use Claude Opus 5 for every review pass. Run non-interactively at high reasoning in plan/read-only mode:

A typical invocation is:

```bash
claude -p "<focused review prompt>" \
  --model claude-opus-5 \
  --effort high \
  --permission-mode plan \
  --tools "Read,Grep,Glob,Bash"
```

Include the requirements, implementation scope, changed files or diff, checks, and pre-existing changes to ignore. Require numbered findings with severity, file/line, failure mode, and fix direction, plus an explicit statement when there are no findings. Exclude formatting, naming, subjective style, and unrelated improvements. Treat findings as evidence, not authority.

Retain the review output until the final report is complete. Present every usable reviewer finding in `Review 結果`, including rejected findings and findings fixed before a later clean pass. Do not replace the findings with only a pass/fail conclusion, a count, “已修正”, or the final reviewer approval. Faithfully summarize each finding; quote the reviewer only when its exact wording matters. Exact duplicates may be consolidated only when all original finding IDs are listed.

### Immediate Finding Disclosure

After each review invocation returns, send a commentary update before editing any code in response to that review. Do not defer this disclosure to the final report.

Use the heading `Claude Opus 5 Review Pass N — 初始 findings（尚未經 Codex 驗證）` and include the provider plus every usable finding's ID, severity, file/line, failure mode, impact, and proposed fix direction. State clearly that Codex may accept or reject each finding after inspecting the code. When the reviewer reports no findings, immediately say `本 pass 無 findings`.

After validation, send a second concise commentary update with the acceptance or rejection of each finding and the reason before or while applying accepted fixes. The later final report remains the authoritative record of findings, decisions, changes, and verification.

### Wait Limit

Use a cumulative 30-minute wait budget for all Claude review invocations in the workflow, including a final pass after fixes:

- Record how long each Claude invocation runs. A later pass may use only the wait budget left by earlier passes.
- Do not declare a timeout merely because Claude has not produced intermediate output.
- Poll or wait in intervals no longer than 60 seconds, and give the user a concise status update at least every 60 seconds while the review is still running.
- When the cumulative wait reaches 30 minutes, terminate any running Claude invocation and do not start another one, even if a pass appears to be making progress.
- Do not retry after exhausting the wait budget; timeout is not a clearly correctable invocation error. Use the fallback below for any required review pass.

## Claude Failure Fallback

If Claude returns no usable review—because of access, quota, policy, authentication, timeout, tooling, context, or malformed output—retry once only when the invocation is clearly correctable; otherwise use independent Codex review:

```bash
cat > /tmp/codex-review.sh <<'WRAPPER'
#!/bin/sh
codex exec -C "$PWD" \
  --model gpt-6-astra \
  --config 'model_reasoning_effort="medium"' \
  review - > /tmp/codex-review.log 2>&1 <<'EOF'
<same review context>
EOF
echo "CODEX_EXIT=$?" >> /tmp/codex-review.log
WRAPPER
chmod +x /tmp/codex-review.sh
nohup /tmp/codex-review.sh > /tmp/codex-review-launcher.log 2>&1 &
```

Never run `codex exec` in the foreground or as a directly tracked background command; it is killed at the tool timeout or on session restart, and a killed pass emits no findings. Use `nohup`, not `setsid` (macOS has no `setsid`), keep the launcher's output visible, and poll the log for the `CODEX_EXIT=` line as the only completion signal. Resume a killed pass with `codex exec resume --last`. Pass the same review context through stdin (`-`) using a heredoc inside the wrapper, never as a file argument to `codex`, and state the review scope in the first line of the prompt. Instruct Codex not to run test suites or package-manager commands, and list the changed files in the prompt. Immediately identify the fallback with the specific, sanitized reason:

```text
Review provider: Codex (fallback — Claude unavailable: <specific reason>)
```

After fallback, use Codex for remaining passes and count them toward the two-pass limit. State that the review was independent, not cross-model, and never imply Claude approved it. If fallback also fails, report both failures and stop review work.

## Final Report

Write explanations and headings in Traditional Chinese; preserve commands, identifiers, paths, model names, and required provider labels. Lead with outcomes, not chronology. Use exactly these sections:

```markdown
## 實作結果

- 第一點先說明本次開發要解決的使用者／系統問題、原本缺少的能力，以及完成後具備的能力。
- 其餘 1–3 點列出使用者可見行為與重要架構結果。

## 檔案摘要

### `path/to/file.ts` — 新增／修改／刪除／重新命名

- **開發目的**：先指出這個檔案承接哪一項需求或使用情境、原本的缺口／風險，以及它在整體開發中負責完成什麼能力。
- **具體變更**：指出變更的元件、函式、型別、schema、route、設定鍵或測試案例，以及各自改了什麼。
- **設計理由**：說明為什麼選擇這個 boundary、資料結構或流程，以及它如何滿足限制或避免已知風險；沒有非顯而易見的設計判斷時省略。
- **行為與資料流**：說明重要條件、狀態轉換、輸入輸出、錯誤處理或呼叫鏈的前後差異；不適用時省略。
- **驗證重點**：列出這個檔案所涵蓋或新增的成功、失敗與邊界案例；若只由整體檢查涵蓋，指出對應命令。

## Review 結果

- 先明確說明 Claude Opus 5 是否完成 review；若使用 fallback，列出規定的完整 provider label。
- 依 pass 逐項呈現 reviewer 回傳的每一個可用 finding，不論接受、拒絕或已在後續 pass 解決：
  - `[finding ID] severity — path:line`（reviewer 未提供位置時明確註明）。
  - **Reviewer finding**：忠實呈現 failure mode、觸發條件、影響與 reviewer 建議的修正方向；不可只寫 finding 標題或最終結論。
  - **判定**：接受／拒絕，以及 Codex 驗證後的具體理由。
  - **處理與驗證**：接受時列出修正與檢查；拒絕時明確寫「未修改」及支持判定的證據。
- reviewer 明確回傳沒有 findings 時，寫出「本 pass 無 findings」，不可省略該 pass。

## 驗證

- `command`：結果與重要計數。

## 剩餘風險

- 只列具體風險或未完成步驟；沒有則明確說明。
```

Build `檔案摘要` from starting status and final diff. Include every task-owned source, test, support, config, documentation, deletion, rename, and review fix; exclude pre-existing user changes. Create one subsection per path and list each path exactly once.

Make every entry concrete enough that the user can understand the implementation without opening the diff:

- Derive `開發目的` from the plan, acceptance criteria, user scenario, or scoped requirements before reading the diff as an implementation inventory. Do not infer purpose only from symbol names or restate the mechanics as intent.
- Make the role of each file in the overall change explicit: identify what development responsibility it owns, why that responsibility belongs there, and which downstream behavior or requirement depends on it.
- Keep `開發目的`, `具體變更`, and `設計理由` distinct: purpose explains why the capability is needed; concrete change explains what was implemented; design rationale explains why this implementation shape was chosen.
- Name the important symbols, UI regions, endpoints, data fields, configuration keys, or test scenarios changed in that file.
- Describe meaningful before/after behavior, including branching, fallback, validation, state, persistence, side effects, and error handling when relevant.
- For tests, name the exact behavior and edge cases covered and the expected outcome; do not merely say that tests were added.
- For configuration, migrations, generated support files, and documentation, identify the exact entries or sections changed and their runtime or developer-facing effect.
- For deletions, explain which responsibility was removed and where it moved or why it is no longer needed. For renames, show `old/path → new/path` and state whether content also changed.
- Identify changes originating from accepted review findings in the affected file entry.

Avoid vague summaries such as “更新邏輯”, “改善型別”, “重構元件”, “補上測試”, or “調整設定”. Prefer 2–5 information-dense bullets per file, expanding when a file contains multiple independent changes. Do not paste the diff or narrate trivial line-by-line edits.

Use this distinction:

```markdown
<!-- Too mechanical: the reader knows what changed but not why it exists. -->
- **具體變更**：新增 `redactReviewRequestV1` 與三種 detector。

<!-- Purpose-led: the reader can reconstruct the intended development. -->
- **開發目的**：在 `ReviewEngine` 前建立單向 sanitization boundary，避免啟用 cloud transport 時把 diff 中常見的 API key 或 private key 原文送出本機；這個檔案負責 Plan 14 的核心 redacted-request contract。
- **具體變更**：新增 `redactReviewRequestV1`、deterministic replacement tokens，以及 API key、private key、high-entropy token detectors。
- **設計理由**：對完整 request tree 做一次純 traversal，讓 path、patch、prompt 與 model 共用同一政策，避免各 engine adapter 各自 redaction 而產生漏接或行為分歧。
```

State whether Claude Opus 5 completed review. For fallback, repeat the exact provider label and reason, and never imply Claude approved the work.
